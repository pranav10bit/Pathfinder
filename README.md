# Pathfinder
This is a small visualization tool that shows the working of A* and Dijkstra's algorithm. Written completely in python, it uses the pygame module to create a grid. We can define a start and an end point in the grid and draw obstacles between them. Then the algorithm of choice is at work and all the nodes that are visited are coloured the shortest path between the start and end node is then highlighted. It is a very simple program but great for learning these algorithms. I have used priority queue in this particular case to implement the algorithms
